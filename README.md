# Toolbar Timer
This is a Chrome extension that attaches a countdown timer to your web browser's toolbar. <br/>
It can be conveniently accessed at the upper-right corner of your browser window and it will stay there like a rock. <br/>
The next time you're doing work like taking a practice exam, you would be constantly able to see how much time you have left on that clock. <br/><br/>

## Packing the Extension
- Navigate to chrome://extensions/ <br/>
- Click on "LOAD EXTENSION" <br/>
- Select "Toolbar-Timer" <br/><br/>

## To Stabilize the Pop-Up Window
- Right click on the pop-up window (not the icon) & select "inspect" <br/>
- Minimize the inspect window <br/>
*This is the only way, offered by Chrome, to keep a pop-up window stable as of now* <br/><br/>

## Room For Improvement
- Being able to stabilize the pop-up window when the web page is switched to a different tab <br/>
- Being able to see the components of the web page under the pop-up window <br/><br/>
