# Toolbar Timer
This is a Chrome extension that attaches a countdown timer to your web browser's toolbar. <br/> <br/>
You can access it at ease at the upper-right corner of your browser window and prevent overcrowding windows when performing tasks like taking a practice exam. <br/> <br/>

## Packing the Extension
1) Navigate to chrome://extensions/ <br/>
2) Click on "LOAD EXTENSION" <br/>
3) Select "Toolbar-Timer" <br/> <br/>

## To Stabilize the Pop-Up Window
1) Right click on the pop-up window (not the icon) & select "inspect" <br/>
2) Minimize the inspect window <br/>
*This is the only way, offered by Chrome, to keep a pop-up window stable as of now* <br/>
